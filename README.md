# First-Project
My very first project on GitHub. It is an implementation of k-Nearest-Neighbours algorithm using NumPy, Pandas, load_dataset from Seaborn and collections from Counter.
I am very new to Machine Learning so this code is not perfect and not the most effective. 
In this example it uses "penguins" dataset and a fixed point on the grid, both can be re-defined at your wish.  
I would be glad to hear any suggestions on how to improve this code. Thank you for your attention :)
